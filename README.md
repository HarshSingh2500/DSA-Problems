# DSA Journey
This repository is a dedicated space for my daily practice and solutions to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems. The goal is to consistently improve my problem-solving skills, explore various algorithmic paradigms, and deepen my understanding of fundamental data structures.

You'll find solutions implemented primarily in Python, JavaScript, Java. Problems are sourced from platforms like LeetCode, GeeksForGeeks, HackerRank, and other competitive programming sites.

Key areas covered include:

Arrays & Strings

Linked Lists

Trees & Graphs

Hashing

Sorting & Searching

Dynamic Programming

And more...

This ongoing journey aims to build a strong foundation in algorithmic thinking and prepare for technical interviews.
